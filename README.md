# Quantum_N_Bit_Computer_Simulator_with_GUI
Operational QBit Computer Simulator with functioning GUI - DUTH

The user is able to set up a variable number of Quantum bits for the simulation while also setting up the number of steps/quantum gates that will be used on the bits themselves

The input and output data can be set and viwed through the tool's GUI, which can **Create**/set up the number of bits and steps, **Reset** the simulation and finally **Run** it. The output ofthe simulation will be outputed in the line below the aforementioned buttons
